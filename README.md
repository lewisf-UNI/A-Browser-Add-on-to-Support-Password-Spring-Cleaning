# A Browser Add-On to Support Password Spring Cleaning

A web based browser extension that supports users through the process of spring cleaning their accounts and passwords. 

This was undertaken as my 4th Year Project. 

The IDE used to run this project was Visual Studio Code therefore this IDE is recommended when running the code.

To do this follow these steps: 

Before running the browser add-on, a device is required for installation. This device must be a computer 
or laptop connected to the internet that can run a desktop version, ideally the most recent version, of 
any of the following browsers:
• Google Chrome 
• Microsoft Edge
• Opera 
For installation, you should use the corresponding guide to which browser you are using. 


Google Chrome - 

In the address bar, navigate to:
chrome://extensions
Once on this page, enable developer mode in the top right of the page. The option to ‘Load Unpacked’ 
should appear. Click this and select the folder from where you have saved it. 
At this point, the extension should be successfully installed and can be accessed through the extensions 
tab in Google Chrome at the top of the page. 

Microsoft Edge - 

In the address bar, navigate to:
edge://extensions
At the left of the page, enable developer mode. Once active, select the ‘Load Unpacked’ option and 
select the folder from where you have saved it. 
At this point, the extension should be successfully installed and can be accessed through the extensions 
tab in Microsoft Edge at the top of the page.

Opera - 

In the address bar, navigate to:
opera://extensions
Once on this page, enable developer mode in the top right of the page. The option to ‘Load Unpacked’ 
should appear. Click this and select the folder from where you have saved it. 
At this point, the extension should be successfully installed and can be accessed through the extensions 
tab in Opera at the top of the page.
